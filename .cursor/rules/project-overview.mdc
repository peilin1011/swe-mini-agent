# nano-SWE-agent overview

nano-SWE-agent implements an AI software engineering agent that solves github issues.
It interfaces with a package called SWE-ReX that provides sandboxed code execution.
The idea of this project is to write the simplest, smallest, most readable agent.
It does not have to be state of the art or the most robust agent.
It only serves as a tutorial and a baseline.
