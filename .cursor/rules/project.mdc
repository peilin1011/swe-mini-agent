# nano-SWE-agent overview

- nano-SWE-agent implements an AI software engineering agent that solves github issues and similar programming challenges
- The idea of this project is to write the simplest, smallest, most readable agent.

The project is structured as

```bash
nanoswea/__init__  # Protocols/interfaces for all base classes
nanoswea/agents  # Agent control flow & loop
nanoswea/environments  # Executing agent actions
nanoswea/models  # LM interfaces
nanoswea/run  # Run scripts that serve as an entry point
```

- The project embraces polymorphism: Every individual class should be simple, but we offer alternatives
- Every use case should start with a run script, that picks one agent, environment, and model class to run
