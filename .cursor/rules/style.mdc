# Style guide

- Target python 3.11 or higher
- Use python with type annotations. Use `list` instead of `List`.
- Use `pathlib` instead of `os.path`. Use `Path.read_text()` over `with ...open()` constructs.
- Use `typer` to add interfaces
- Keep code comments to a minimum and only highlight particularly logically challenging things
- Do not append to the README unless specifically requested
- Use `jinja` for formatting templates
- Use `dataclass` for keeping track config
- Do not catch exceptions unless explicitly told to.
- Write concise, short, minimal code.

## Test style

- Use `pytest`, not `unittest`.
- <IMPORTANT>Do not mock/patch anything that you're not explicitly asked to do</IMPORTANT>
- Avoid writing trivial tests. Every test should test for at least one, preferably multiple points of failure
