<h1>The 100 line AI agent that solves GitHub issues</h1>

</div>

nano-SWE-agent is an AI agent implemented in [100 lines of python](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/agent.py)!
Okay, maybe add another 100 lines for a [minimal sandboxed environment](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/environment.py) 
and [model config](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/model.py) -- but that's it, and no fancy packages used!

This is enough to solve XX% of the issues in SWE-bench verified, one of the most popular benchmarks to test agentic capabilities.

It's simple, readable, and an excellent starting point for your AI agent
journey!

It's also modular & composable, and we expect to have lots of compatible goodies in the `extra/` directories soon.

## ðŸ”¥ Let's fire it up!

Just try it without installing

```bash
pip install pipx && pipx run nano-swe-agent
```

Install it for experimentation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent.git
cd nano-swe-agent
pip install -e .
```

This will expose `nswea` (local agent) and `nswea-gh` (run on github issues with docker as sandbox).
But you can also just run the executables as

```bash
python nanoswea/run_local.py
```

etc.

You can put your LM API keys in a `.env` at the repository root or make sure they're set in your shell.
You can also change default behaviors by setting the following variables in `.env` or in the environment:

```bash
NSWEA_MODEL_NAME="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # your favorite model
NSWEA_LOCAL_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/your/own/config"  # override the default config for nswea 
```
