<h1>The 100 line AI agent that solves GitHub issues & more</h1>

</div>

- **üêú Tiny**: Just [100 lines of python](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/agents/default.py) (+100 for [env](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/environments/local.py),
[model model](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/models/litellm_model.py), [script](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/run/hello_world.py)) ‚Äî no fancy dependencies!
- **üí™ Powerful:** Resolves XX% of GitHub issues in the [SWE-bench verified benchmark](https://www.swebench.com/).
- **ü§ó Friendly:** Comes with extended variants that will turn this into your daily dev swiss army knife!
- **üéì Cutting edge:** Built by the Princeton & Stanford team behind [SWE-bench](https://swe-bench.com) and [SWE-agent](https://swe-agent.com).

Use it to

- üî• Instantly solve problems: `pip install pipx && pipx run micro-swe-agent`
- ‚öôÔ∏è Take full control & quickly build custom agents
- üèã Fine-tune & RL with a minimal, assumption-free agen
- üê≥ Deploy seamlessly to sandboxed environments

## üî• Try it!

```bash
pip install pipx && pipx run --spec git+ssh://git@github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent micro-swe-agent
```

<summary>Details</summary>

[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) will install `micro-swe-agent` in an isolated environment and directly run it.
If the invocation doesn't immediately work, you might need to run `pipx ensurepath`.
After the first time, it's enough to just run `pipx run micro-swe-agent`.

<summary>Example prompts</summary>

- Implement a Sudoku solver in python in the `sudoku` folder. Make sure the codebase is modular and well tested with pytest. 
- Please run pytest on the current project, discover failing unittests and help me fix them. Always make sure to test the final solution.
- Help me document & type my codebase by adding short docstrings and type hints.

## üöÄ Developer version

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent.git
cd micro-swe-agent
pip install -e .
```

And welcome your new friend:

```bash
micro
```

which you can also evoke as

```bash
python microswea/run/local.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure

All global configuration can be either set as environment variables, or
in the `.env` file (the exact location is printed when you run `micro`).

```bash
# set default config for micro
MSWEA_LOCAL_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/your/own/config"
# set default model
MSWEA_MODEL_NAME="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Power up <a target="powerup"/>

We provide several different entry points to the agent,
for example [hello world](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/run/hello_world.py),
or the [default when calling `micro`](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/run/local.py).

Want to cook up your custom version and the config is not enough?
Just follow the recipe below:

1. What's the control flow you need? Pick an [agent class](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/agents) (e.g., [simplest example](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/agents/default.py), [with human in the loop](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/agents/interactive.py))
2. How should actions be executed? Pick an [environment class](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/environments) (e.g., [local](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/environments/local.py), or [docker](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/environments/docker.py))
3. How is the LM queried? Pick a [model class](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/models) (e.g., [litellm](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/models/litellm_model.py))
4. How to invoke the agent? Bind them all together in a [run script](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/run), possibly reading from a [config](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/config) (e.g., [hello world](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/run/hello_world.py), or [`micro` entry point](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/blob/main/microswea/run/local.py))

We aim to keep all of these components very simple, but offer lots of choice between them -- enough to cover a broad range of
things that you might want to do.

You can override the default entry point by setting the `MSWEA_DEFAULT_RUN` environment variable to the import path of your run script.

We happily accept contributions!

<summary>Areas of help</summary>

- Support for more models (anything where `litellm` doesn't work out of the box)
- Documentation, examples, tutorials, etc.
- Support for more environments & deployments (e.g., run it as a github action, etc.)
- Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/issues) and see if there's anything you'd like to work on!

<details>
<summary>Design & Architecture</summary>

- `micro-swe-agent` aims to stay minimalistic & hackable
- To extend features, we prefer to add a new version of the one of the four components above, rather than making the existing components more complex
- Components should be relatively self-contained, but if there are utilities that might be shared, add a `utils` folder (like [this one](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/tree/main/microswea/models/utils)). But keep it simple!
- If your component is a bit more specific, add it into an `extra` folder (like [this one](https://github.com/SWE-agent/micro-swe-agent/tree/main/microswea/run/extra))
- Our target audience is anyone who doesn't shy away from modifying a bit of code (especially a run script) to get what they want
- Therefore, not everything needs to be configurable with the config files, but it should be easy to use with a run script
- Many LMs write very verbose code -- please clean it up! Same goes for the tests. They should still be concise and readable.
- Please install `pre-commit` (`pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`) and run it before committing. This will enforce our style guide.
